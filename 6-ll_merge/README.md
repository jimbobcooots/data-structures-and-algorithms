# Merge two Linked Lists
- Goal is to merge two linked lists with O(1) space complexity meaning we cannot produce a third linked list to merge their values
- Linked lists are linear data structures where each node is a separate object
- My algorithm is to set a temp variable for my list1's.next to save the value, and to delete the head of my second linked list once it's added to my list1 so that the head is reset to teh next value every time and is ready to be pushed into list 1
