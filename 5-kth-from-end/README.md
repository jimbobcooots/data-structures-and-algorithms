# kth from the end of a Linked List
- Spoke with Noah about potential solution and he suggested grabbing the length of the linked list and setting an offset to find the kth value from the end
- Still struggled with implementing this, and couldn't translate this to pseudocode, the furthest I got was knowing I needed a "for" loop but still having difficulty defining the condition and starting point of the for loop.
​
## Challenge
Write a method for the Linked List class which takes a number, k, as a parameter. Return the node that is k from the end of the linked list. You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges. ​
